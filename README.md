#  What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.

## In a nutshell:

HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites.

HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.

HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.

There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.

HTML is interpreted by browser

## There are two component of Hyper-Text Markup Language 
### 1-HyperText

### 2-Markup-language

## HyperText:
It means any text in which there are hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are mostly used to navigate from one page to another page, for e.g: while reading any book you flip the page but in webpages there are hyperlinks that are used to flip/navigate from one page to another.
hyperlinks can be in the form of text, images, etc...

## Markup-language:
In simple words, it is a set of tags that converts HTML text into tables, images, link etc ...

## HTML Working
You must have heard of frontend and backend. Frontend refers to the visible part of a website or app that users interact with, like the tables, images, and buttons. It's built using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend, on the other hand, handles behind-the-scenes operations like storing and processing data when users interact with the frontend. It uses languages like Python, Ruby, and Java. In essence, frontend is what users see, while backend manages the functionality.

How do websites work?

When we want to access any information on the internet, we search for it using a web browser. The web browser retrieves the content from web servers, where it is stored in the form of HTML documents.

## Attribute 
Every HTML element has predefined Attributes, Attributes will always written in starting tag and they give additional information about element. 

for example:
## <img width="100" ></img>
In above example "width" is the Attribute which is telling the <img />  tag  that the width of img will be 100.

## Attribute has two parts:
## name = "value"

# Heading tag
In HTML there are six tags used for Heading, also known as six level of Heading. They basically work in descending order lets explore them:

# paragraph tag
Every paragraph is written inside this tag.

Every paragraph content will be displayed in new line when you close the tag.

### <p>Welcome to Techverse51</p>

# Italic and Bold
### <i>This will convert text into italic</i>
### <b>This will covert text into Bold</b>

# Line break and Horizontal rule tag
As we know that when we close the paragraph tag browser will automatically change the line, But if we want to break line in the same paragraph So we have to use break tag that is :
### <br/>

To break or give space within a paragraph we use Horizontal rule. Mostly it is used for breaking sections.

### <hr/>

Now in both <br/> and <hr/> , there is no closing tag this is because they are self closing tags or also known as empty element.

# image tag
It is also an self closing tag or empty element.

It contain some Attributes, but the most common are src, alt, title.

### <img src="" alt="" title="" />
